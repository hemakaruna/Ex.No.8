## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date :25.09.2025
# Reg. No:212223060089

## Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

## Procedure:

1. **Analyze the Given Image**  
   Examine the image carefully, noting key elements such as:  
   - **Objects/Subjects** – person (portrait in realism)  
   - **Colors** – natural skin tones, muted realistic hues  
   - **Textures** – smooth shading, fabric details  
   - **Lighting** – balanced natural highlights and shadows  
   - **Background** – neutral background keeping focus on subject  
   - **Composition** – centered figure with calm expression  
   - **Style** – classic realism, detailed and lifelike  


2. **Create the Basic Prompt**  
A portrait of a person in classic realism style, sitting in a natural pose with a calm expression.


3. **Refine the Prompt with More Detail**  
A detailed portrait of a person in classic realism style, with soft natural lighting, muted tones, realistic textures, and a neutral background. The subject has a composed expression and a steady gaze, maintaining focus on the face.

4. **Identify Style and Artistic Influences**  
To reproduce the image in another style (e.g., Studio Ghibli):  
A Studio Ghibli-inspired portrait of a person, keeping the same pose and calm expression from a realistic painting. The artwork has soft pastel tones, expressive anime-style eyes, painterly hand-drawn textures, and a dreamy whimsical background.

5. **Adjust and Fine-tune**  
- If pose changes → add: *"identical pose as original portrait"*  
- If expression changes → add: *"same calm expression as original"*  
- If background gets noisy → add: *"plain dreamy background"*  


6. **Generate the Image**  
Use the crafted prompt in a tool such as:  
- **DALL·E** (OpenAI)  
- **Stable Diffusion** (Open-source)  
- **MidJourney** (artistic stylization)  

7. **Compare the Generated Image with the Original**  
Assess similarities and differences in **color, composition, pose, and expression**. Refine prompts if necessary.

## Tools/LLMs for Image Generation
- **DALL·E (OpenAI):** Precise realism reproduction.  
- **Stable Diffusion:** Flexible customization and fine control.  
- **MidJourney:** Best for stylized Ghibli/anime transformations.

## Instructions
1. **Examine the Given Image** – note colors, lighting, and subject.  
2. **Write the Basic Prompt** – describe only the subject and pose.  
3. **Refine and Add Details** – include textures, lighting, colors, and mood.  
4. **Use the Selected Tool** – input prompt into AI generator.  
5. **Iterate and Adjust** – refine until close to original.  
6. **Save and Document** – save both versions for comparison.

## Deliverables

1. **The Original Image**  
*(Insert chosen realism reference image here)*  

2. **The Final Generated Image (Ghibli Style)**  
*(Insert AI-generated Studio Ghibli version here)*  

3. **Prompts Used**  
- **Basic Prompt:**  
A portrait of a person in classic realism style, sitting in a natural pose with a calm expression.

- **Refined Prompt:**  
A detailed portrait of a person in classic realism style, with soft natural lighting, muted tones, realistic textures, and a neutral background. The subject has a composed expression and a steady gaze.


- **Stylized Prompt (Ghibli):**  
A Studio Ghibli-inspired digital portrait of a person, keeping the same pose and calm expression as the original realism portrait. The artwork features soft pastel colors, painterly hand-drawn textures, warm lighting, large expressive eyes, and a dreamy whimsical background.

| Aspect        | Original Portrait (Classic Realism)                  | Generated Portrait (Studio Ghibli Style)              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pose**      | Centered, natural pose                               | Same pose preserved                                  |
| **Expression**| Calm, composed, steady gaze                          | Calm expression preserved                            |
| **Colors**    | Muted, natural skin tones                            | Warm pastel, dreamy Ghibli color palette             |
| **Textures**  | Realistic shading, detailed fabric                   | Painterly hand-drawn, soft stylization               |
| **Eyes**      | Natural proportion, realistic detail                 | Large, expressive anime/Ghibli-style eyes            |
| **Background**| Neutral, minimal                                     | Plain whimsical pastel background                    |
| **Style**     | Classic realism                                      | Studio Ghibli hand-drawn aesthetic                   |

## Conclusion
By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-image generation models can closely reproduce an existing image while also transforming it into a new style (**Studio Ghibli**).  
This experiment highlights the importance of **prompt refinement, iteration, and tool selection** in achieving creative reinterpretations.  
The approach is especially useful for **animation, concept art, and digital design applications**.
